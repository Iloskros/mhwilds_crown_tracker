Hey just Frankenstein this together because I wanted a pretty way to track crowns on Monster Hunter Wilds. I might update it or not, but hopefully you get some use out of it.

Features:
Runs offline because I didn't want to host anything and if I was sharing it to everyone I didn't want people to be sketched out.
Toggle Crowns to display when a crown has been obtained or not.
Investigation Dropdown to keep track of how many investigations you have left of a crown monster to share with friends.

How to Use:
Extract the compressed folder.
Ensure the icons folder is in the same folder as monster_tracker.html
Simply open monster_tracker.html and it will open an offline page that has the tracker on it.
Click on crowns to enable to disable them representing your progress.
Use the drop down to keep track of remaining investigations.

Happy Hunting!
